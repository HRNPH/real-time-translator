# Whisper.cpp Realtime Translator

This is a personal project that provides real-time translation from Japanese to English using Whisper.cpp. It works for me to watch Hololive livestreams and get a basic understanding of what's being said. It's not perfect, but it does the job. I'm not planning on maintaining this regularly, though I might tweak it if I need to.

## Features

- **Real-Time Translation**: Converts audio from Japanese to English in real-time.
- **Audio Input Options**: Supports desktop audio and microphone as input sources.
- **Auto-Pruning**: Replaces incomplete or redundant lines with the latest, more complete ones.
- **Repetition Filtering**: Removes repetitive lines caused by silence or noise.
- **Simple GUI**: Lets you start, stop, and clear translations easily.

## How to Use

1. **Run the App**:
   - Clone the repository.
   - Install the dependencies (see below).
   - Run `main.py`.

2. **Select Input**:
   - Choose **Desktop Audio** to translate audio from your system.
   - Choose **Microphone** to translate audio from a mic.

3. **Start Translating**:
   - Click **Start Translation** to begin.
   - Click **Stop Translation** to end the translation session.

4. **Clear Output**:
   - If the output gets too cluttered, use the **Clear** button to reset it.

## Dependencies

### Python Libraries
- **NLTK**: For detecting repetition in translations.
  
Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

Download NLTK's tokenizer models:

```bash
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
```

### Whisper.cpp
- You need Whisper.cpp installed on your system. Follow the [Whisper.cpp installation guide](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp).

### Whisper Model
- Download a Whisper model like `ggml-large-v2-q5_0.bin` and place it in the `models` directory:

```bash
curl -o models/ggml-large-v2-q5_0.bin https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-large-v2-q5_0.bin
```

## Logs

- Logs are saved in `translator.log` for debugging.
- Includes translation process events and filtered lines.

---

## Known Issues

- **Repetitive Lines**: The app filters repetition, but itâ€™s not perfect. Adjust repetition detection thresholds if needed.
- **Performance**: If the model lags, use a smaller Whisper model.

## Disclaimer

- This app was built for my personal use. It works for watching Hololive livestreams and understanding some context, but that's about it.
- **No guarantees, no promises.** Use it as-is.

## Why I Made This

I wanted a quick way to understand Hololive streams without waiting for subtitles. This app works well enough for that. Itâ€™s not perfect, but it scratches the itch. 

If it works for you too, great. If not, well, I wasn't really planning on making it a polished product anyway. ðŸ˜Š

Enjoy! ðŸŽ¤
